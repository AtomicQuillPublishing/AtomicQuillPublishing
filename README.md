<h2 align="center">Hello and welcome to the Atomic Quill Publishing repository!</h2>

In this space, you'll find all the supplements and homebrew documents that *Atomic Quill* has crafted. Most of these documents are for **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**, but you'll also find various TTRPG-related musings.

***Quick Note from Emerald:*** 
<p>A lot of this content was created by myself with the help of AI. As a result, not all of it has been playtested for balance. Think of this as a living journal filled with creative ideas I thought would be fun to incorporate into a D&D campaign. Please keep that in mind when using any of the documents or PDFs found here.</p>

<h3 align="center">Dive in and enjoy crafting your next adventure with Atomic Quill!</h3>
